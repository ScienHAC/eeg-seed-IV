# SEED-IV EEG Emotion Recognition Dataset Explorer

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive web-based exploration of the SEED-IV dataset, which contains EEG (electroencephalography) brain signals recorded during emotional experiences. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can automatically recognize human emotions from brain activity patterns.

## 📊 Dataset Information

### SEED-IV Dataset Structure
- **Participants**: 15 subjects (6 males, 9 females)
- **Sessions**: 3 sessions per participant (on different days)
- **Trials**: 24 trials per session (72 unique film clips total)
- **Emotions**: 4 categories - Neutral (0), Sad (1), Fear (2), Happy (3)
- **EEG Channels**: 62 electrodes covering the entire scalp
- **Sampling Rate**: 1000 Hz (downsampled to 200 Hz for processing)

### Data Structure (3D)
The processed data has a 3-dimensional structure:
- **Dimension 1**: 62 EEG channels (brain electrode positions)
- **Dimension 2**: 5 frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
- **Dimension 3**: ~42 time windows (4-second segments)

**Total Features**: 62 × 5 × ~42 = 13,020+ features per trial

## 🔬 Research Methodology

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Raw EEG Acquisition**: 62-channel signals recorded at 1000Hz
2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Bandpass filtering (1-75 Hz)
   - Downsampling to 200Hz
   - Artifact removal
3. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Differential Entropy (DE) computation
   - Analysis across 5 frequency bands
   - 4-second sliding windows
4. **Machine Learning**: Train classifiers for 4-emotion recognition

### Frequency Bands
- **Delta (1-4 Hz)**: Deep sleep, unconscious processes
- **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Drowsiness, memory processing, emotional arousal
- **Alpha (8-14 Hz)**: Relaxation, reduced attention
- **Beta (14-31 Hz)**: Active thinking, alertness, problem-solving
- **Gamma (31-50 Hz)**: Higher-level cognitive functions, attention

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Python 3.8+ (for data processing scripts)
- Required Python packages: `scipy`, `numpy`, `pandas`

### Running the Website

**⚠️ Important**: Due to browser security restrictions (CORS policy), you cannot simply open `index.html` directly. You need to run a local web server.

#### Method 1: Using the Provided Batch File (Windows)
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Double-click `start_server.bat` in the project folder
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`
4. Navigate through different sections using the top menu

#### Method 2: Manual Server Setup
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal in the project directory
2. Run one of these commands:
   ```bash
   # Using Python (recommended)
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if installed)
   npx http-server
   
   # Using PHP (if installed)
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`
4. Use the Interactive Data Explorer to examine real EEG data

#### Troubleshooting
- If you get "python is not recognized", install Python from python.org
- If port 8000 is busy, try a different port: `python -m http.server 8080`
- Make sure `simple_output1.csv` is in the same folder as `index.html`

### Processing Additional Data
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scipy numpy pandas
   ```
2. Place MATLAB (.mat) files in the appropriate directory
3. Run the conversion script:
   ```bash
   python matTocsv.py
   ```
4. Update the `csvFileMap` in `index.html` to include new files

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Feature Extraction: Differential Entropy (DE)
Differential Entropy measures the complexity or randomness of EEG signals:
- Higher DE values indicate more complex, information-rich brain activity
- Computed for each frequency band separately
- Smoothed using Moving Average or Linear Dynamic System (LDS) methods

### Data Format
CSV files contain features organized as:
- **Columns**: Ch1_Freq1, Ch1_Freq2, ..., Ch62_Freq5 (310 total)
- **Rows**: Time windows (typically 40-50 per trial)
- **Values**: Differential Entropy features (floating-point numbers)
